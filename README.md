# 🧠 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning in R

This project applies various machine learning algorithms to predict diabetes risk using health metrics. It includes exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, visualizations, and performance evaluation of models like KNN. The project was done using the R programming language.


## 📁 Dataset Features

The dataset contains the following attributes:

- `cholesterol`
- `glucose`
- `hdl_chol` (Good cholesterol)
- `age`
- `gender`
- `height`
- `weight`
- `bmi`
- `systolic_bp`, `diastolic_bp`
- `waist`, `hip`
- `diabetes` (Targt variable)

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Bar Plots**: Gender, diabetes status
- **Histograms**: Cholesterol, glucose, BMI, age, blood pressure, etc.
- **Boxplots**: Outlier detection in key metrics
- **Transformations**: Cleaned BMI (converted from text to numeric)

## ⚙️ Model Building

The dataset was split into **80% training** and **20% testing** sets.

**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** was used for classification, with normalization applied to numeric features.
